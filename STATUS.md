# Docktor Project Status - October 22, 2025

## ✅ What's Working

### Core Infrastructure
- **MCP Protocol Integration**: Fully functional JSON-RPC communication
  - Fixed `notifications/initialized` handler
  - All 4 tools successfully registered: `get_metrics`, `detect_anomalies`, `propose_scale`, `apply_scale`
  - Debug logging working ([/tmp/docktor-mcp-debug.log](file:///tmp/docktor-mcp-debug.log))

### Model Integration
- **Docker Model Runner**: Successfully integrated
  - Using `dmr/ai/llama3.2` provider (3.21B parameters)
  - No OpenAI API keys required - completely local operation
  - Model downloads automatically on first use

### Agent Capabilities with Llama 3.2
- ✅ **Multi-step tool orchestration**: Agent successfully calls get_metrics → detect_anomalies → apply_scale in correct sequence
- ✅ **Conditional logic**: Understands "if recommendation==scale_down, then call apply_scale with target=2"
- ✅ **Tool parameter handling**: Correctly passes parameters between tools
- ✅ **Docker integration**: Successfully executes `docker compose --scale` commands

### Example of Successful Iteration
```
Calling get_metrics(container_regex: "web", window_sec: 30)
→ metrics: {"examples-web-1": 0, "examples-web-2": 0}

Calling detect_anomalies(metrics: {...}, rules: {cpu_high_pct: 80, cpu_low_pct: 25})
→ recommendation: "scale_down", reason: "avg_cpu 0.0 <= 25.0"

Calling apply_scale(service: "web", target_replicas: 2, reason: "cpu_low")
→ SUCCESS: scaled web to 2
```

## ❌ What's Not Working

### Continuous Loop Operation
- **Problem**: Agent exits after ONE successful iteration instead of looping continuously
- **Symptom**: Daemon process dies after completing get_metrics → detect_anomalies → apply_scale sequence
- **Root Cause**: Even with explicit "LOOP FOREVER" instructions, the agent treats this as a single task and exits when "done"

### Why This Happens
1. **cagent Architecture**: Appears designed for request-response pattern, not autonomous daemon mode
   - User provides prompt → Agent executes task → Agent waits for next prompt
   - The `--yolo` flag auto-approves tools but doesn't create a true infinite loop

2. **LLM Limitations**: Even Llama 3.2 (3B) lacks "daemon mindset"
   - Understands complex instructions ✅
   - Follows multi-step workflows ✅
   - Maintains infinite self-driven loop ❌

## 📊 Model Comparison

| Model | Parameters | Multi-Step Tasks | Tool Orchestration | Continuous Loop |
|-------|-----------|------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **SmolLM2** | 361M | ❌ Fails | ❌ Calls wrong tools | ❌ N/A |
| **Llama 3.2** | 3.21B | ✅ Success | ✅ Perfect sequence | ❌ Exits after 1 iteration |

### Why SmolLM2 Failed
- Too small to track state across multiple tool calls
- Couldn't follow "do A, then B with A's results, then C based on B's output"
- Skipped `detect_anomalies` and went straight to `propose_scale` in a loop

### Why Llama 3.2 is Better (But Still Not Enough)
- 8x more parameters = much better reasoning
- Successfully handles conditional workflows
- Problem: Doesn't understand "run forever" - LLMs are trained to "complete tasks" not "be daemons"

## 🎯 Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Wrapper Script with Restart Loop (Quick Fix)
Create an external loop that restarts cagent after each iteration:

```bash
while true; do
  echo "Starting iteration..." | cagent run ...
  sleep 10
done
```

**Pros**: Simple, works with current setup
**Cons**: Not truly autonomous, loses context between iterations

### Option 2: Modified Agent Architecture (Better)
Create a custom agent runtime that:
1. Calls the LLM once to get the decision logic
2. Implements the loop in code (not relying on LLM to loop)
3. Uses LLM only for decision-making at each iteration

Example pseudocode:
```python
while True:
    metrics = mcp_call("get_metrics", ...)
    decision = mcp_call("detect_anomalies", ...)

    if decision["recommendation"] == "scale_up":
        mcp_call("apply_scale", target=5)
    elif decision["recommendation"] == "scale_down":
        mcp_call("apply_scale", target=2)

    time.sleep(10)
```

### Option 3: Larger Model (Maybe)
Try models like:
- **Llama 3.1 70B** (if you have GPU)
- **GPT-4o** via OpenAI API
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** via Anthropic API

These might be able to maintain the loop concept, but still unlikely to work as true daemons.

### Option 4: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
Combine the strengths:
1. **Code handles the loop** (reliable, predictable)
2. **LLM makes decisions** (flexible, intelligent)
3. **MCP provides observability** (explainable, auditable)

This is essentially what the `direct.sh` script already does!

## 🔧 Current Files

- [`cmd/docktor/main.go`](cmd/docktor/main.go) - MCP server with all tools
- [`agents/docktor-daemon.yaml`](agents/docktor-daemon.yaml) - Agent config (uses llama3.2)
- [`scripts/daemon.sh`](scripts/daemon.sh) - Daemon launcher (exits after 1 iteration)
- [`scripts/direct.sh`](scripts/direct.sh) - Working autoscaler without LLM (proven reliable)

## 💡 Value Proposition for Docker

**What makes this special:**
1. ✅ **AI-native**: Uses LLM for decision-making (not just hardcoded thresholds)
2. ✅ **Explainable**: MCP protocol provides full audit trail of decisions
3. ✅ **Local-first**: No cloud APIs required - runs with Docker Model Runner
4. ✅ **Tool orchestration**: Demonstrates complex multi-step AI workflows

**What needs improvement:**
1. ❌ True autonomous operation (current: single-iteration execution)
2. ❌ Long-running stability

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### About MCP
- MCP protocol is solid and works well for tool calling
- Debug logging is essential for troubleshooting
- `notifications/initialized` must NOT send a response (it's a notification, not a request)

### About Agent Frameworks
- **cagent** is excellent for interactive tasks but not designed for daemons
- The `--yolo` flag removes approval prompts but doesn't enable continuous operation
- Need to distinguish between "task-completion agents" vs "always-on agents"

### About LLMs
- **3B models** (Llama 3.2): Great for single complex tasks, not for continuous operation
- **<1B models** (SmolLM2): Too small for multi-step tool orchestration
- **Lesson**: Pick model size based on task complexity, not just for continuous operation

## 📈 Next Steps

### Immediate (Make it Work)
1. Implement Option 2: Code-driven loop with LLM decisions
2. Or wrap daemon.sh in an external loop (Option 1)

### Medium-term (Make it Better)
1. Add proper error handling and retry logic
2. Implement health checks and alerting
3. Add metrics/telemetry for monitoring

### Long-term (Production Ready)
1. Test with actual load scenarios
2. Implement gradual scaling (not just 2↔5)
3. Add support for multiple services
4. Create proper logging and observability

## 🚀 Demo-Ready Features

**For showcasing to Docker team:**
1. Show single iteration with Llama 3.2 (works perfectly!)
2. Demonstrate MCP explainability (all decisions logged)
3. Highlight local operation (no API keys needed)
4. Show the tool orchestration working

**Be honest about:**
- Current limitation: needs external loop for continuous operation
- This is a framework limitation, not a concept limitation
- The architecture is sound, just needs a runtime wrapper
